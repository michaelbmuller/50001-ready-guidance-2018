USDOE 50001 READY NAVIGATOR TASK 5
----------TASK VERSION----------
1.0 [content_update.format_update]
----------MENU NAME----------
Energy Policy
----------TITLE----------
Task 5: We have an energy policy statement, which has been approved by top management and communicated across the organization.
----------GETTING IT DONE----------
<ol>
	<li>Draft your energy policy statement.</li>
	<li>Have top management approve the energy policy.</li>
	<li>Incorporate the energy policy into your EnMS awareness program (see [task](Awareness and Communication)).</li>
</ol>
----------TASK OVERVIEW----------
<p>The energy policy is top management&rsquo;s statement of its intentions with respect to your organization&rsquo;s energy performance. The commitments stated in the policy set the direction for energy management activities and provide the framework for using objectives and energy targets to achieve energy performance improvements. The energy policy should be documented and communicated to personnel across all levels of the organization and be available to interested parties.</p>

<p><em>This guidance is relevant to Sections 5.1 b) and 5.2 in the ISO 50001:2018 standard.</em></p>
----------FULL DESCRIPTION----------
<p>[Accordion](Draft the energy policy)</p>

<p>The energy policy must state top management&rsquo;s commitments to the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Continual improvement in energy performance</li>
	<li>Continual improvement of the EnMS</li>
	<li>Ensuring that the information and resources needed to meet objectives and energy targets are available</li>
	<li>Complying with applicable legal requirements and other energy-related requirements relevant to your organization</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, the energy policy must support:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Purchasing of energy-efficient products and services that impact energy performance</li>
	<li>Consideration of energy performance improvement in design activities</li>
</ul>

<p>The policy may be only a few sentences, or it may be several paragraphs long. Simpler and shorter is typically better, but it needs to include the commitments listed above and be appropriate to the nature of your organization.</p>

<p>Sometimes top management or the energy management team will incorporate additional commitments into the energy policy (e.g. sustainability, reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, ENERGY STAR) that are not required by ISO 50001. This is acceptable; however, remember that what is stated in the policy must be demonstrated. In other words, if you say it then you must do it.</p>

<p>Typically, the energy team prepares an initial draft of the energy policy for top management&rsquo;s consideration and approval. The Worksheet can help your team draft the energy policy. If your organization already has an energy policy that can serve as a starting point. Conduct a review to see if the existing policy includes the items listed above.</p>

<p>[Accordion End]</p>
<p>[Accordion](Approve the energy policy)</p>

<p>As a statement of your organization&rsquo;s intentions, top management must take &ldquo;ownership&rdquo; of the energy policy. This includes ensuring that the energy policy is aligned with the strategic direction of the organization. It should support the long term goals of your organization. Evidence of top management&rsquo;s approval of the energy policy can take a variety of forms, from a simple signature and date to a recorded meeting decision.</p>

<p>Typically, the energy policy is incorporated into internal EnMS related communications and EnMS awareness training activities. Also, it can be posted on communication boards or otherwise displayed where it is easily visible. The energy policy also must be available to interested parties, as appropriate.</p>

<p>The energy policy should be reviewed regularly and updated as needed. This is accomplished through the management review process (see [task](Management Review)).</p>

<p>[Accordion End]</p>
----------OTHER ISO EXPERIENCE TIPS----------
<p>Like policies in both ISO 14001:2015 and ISO 9001:2015, the energy policy in a management system is one of the responsibilities of top management. And, although the required policy commitments vary somewhat for each of these standards, they can be combined into a single integrated management system policy. The energy policy commitments of ISO 50001 are often integrated into environmental and/or safety and health management system policies. The energy policy also can be implemented as a stand-alone policy.</p>
----------ENERGY STAR EXPERIENCE TIPS----------
<p>The energy policy your organization drafted in Step 1.3 of the ENERGY STAR Guidelines for Energy Management should be checked to ensure it meets the specific requirements for ISO 50001. An energy policy that adheres to ISO 50001 must commit to continual improvement of both energy performance and the energy management system.  It must also commit to providing needed information and resources to accomplish the objectives and energy targets and meeting compliance obligations (mandatory and voluntary). Also, the energy policy must support the purchase of energy efficient products and services, and consideration of energy performance improvement in design activities.</p>
