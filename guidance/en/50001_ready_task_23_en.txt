----------TASK OVERVIEW----------
<p>An internal audit checks your energy performance and the implementation and effectiveness of your EnMS. It is a systematic and independent process that must be documented. Internal auditors collect and objectively evaluate evidence to determine whether your organization is meeting the requirements of its EnMS and ISO 50001.</p>

<p>Management system audits are system-focused; they are very different from other types of audits with which you may be familiar, such as environmental compliance audits or financial audits. Hence, training in management system auditing is critical for internal auditors. Appropriate resources will be needed to ensure that this training is provided, either in-house or by an external training provider.</p>

<p>The energy management representative often has overall responsibility for the internal audit program. But some organizations assign a separate internal audit program manager.</p>

<p>If your organization has an internal audit program in place for another management system (such as ISO 9001 quality, ISO 14001 environmental, and OHSAS 18001 safety and health), then leverage that existing process and the available in-house internal auditing expertise. However, if you do not already have an internal audit program in place, it is highly recommended that you review the 50001 Ready Navigator resource, [resource](Introduction_Internal_Auditing_Concepts), as well as attend an internal auditing or lead auditor training course to learn how to manage and conduct internal audits.</p>

<p>The results of internal audits, both positive and negative, must be recorded and communicated to top management. These results are often recorded on an audit finding form, a corrective action form, and/or an audit report. It can also be in the form of a PowerPoint presentation. Regardless of the specific style and format used, the results should be communicated with two specific objectives in mind:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Providing objective evidence of effective implementation of the audit process and</li>
	<li>Allowing for corrective action to be addressed and for follow-up requirements to be established and initiated.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>At the completion of this task, you will have&hellip;</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Developed a documented internal audit procedure</li>
	<li>Developed the audit schedule</li>
	<li>Developed the audit plan</li>
	<li>Selected and trained internal auditors</li>
	<li>Conducted internal audits</li>
	<li>Reported internal audit results to top management</li>
	<li>Maintained records of results</li>
</ul>

<p><em>This guidance is relevant to Section 4.6.3 of the ISO 50001:2011 standard.</em></p>
----------FULL DESCRIPTION----------
<p>[Accordion](Develop a documented internal audit procedure)</p>

<p>ISO 50001 requires that you document your internal audit process. This process typically includes:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Purpose of the audit</li>
	<li>Planning and scheduling the audit</li>
	<li>Auditor training requirements</li>
	<li>Conducting the audit</li>
	<li>Documenting the audit results</li>
	<li>Communicating the results to management</li>
	<li>Maintaining records</li>
</ul>

<p>Consider the information provided here when developing an internal audit process that is suited for your organization. Make sure that the procedure clearly identifies the roles and responsibilities of the personnel involved. Structuring the procedure around what needs to be done, when it needs to be done, who needs to do it, and what records will be maintained helps to communicate clearly the expectations for the internal audit system.</p>

<p>[Accordion End]</p>

<p>[Accordion](Develop the audit schedule)</p>

<p>Internal audits must be conducted at planned intervals; they are not surprise activities. The audit program manager (or the management representative) prepares an EnMS internal audit schedule that:</p>

<ul>
	<li>addresses auditing both energy performance and the management system,</li>
	<li>considers the status and importance of the areas and processes, and</li>
	<li>considers the results of previous audits.</li>
</ul>

<p>Since ISO 50001 requires that you consider the status and importance of areas and processes when developing the audit schedule, attention typically is given to the areas and processes associated with the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Significant energy uses</li>
	<li>Energy objectives</li>
	<li>Energy targets</li>
	<li>Energy management action plans</li>
	<li>Operational and maintenance controls</li>
	<li>Activities related to sustaining energy improvements over time</li>
</ul>

<p>The internal audit schedule usually covers an annual period, but may be for shorter or longer periods. You may decide to conduct one internal audit per year that covers the entire EnMS. Or, you may decide to conduct a series of shorter audits that together cover all of the EnMS requirements within a defined period. Some organizations decide to conduct internal audits of energy performance separately from internal audits of the management system. Whatever approach you use, schedule audits based on status and importance of the areas and processes.</p>

<p>[Learn More](Importance in developing an audit schedule)</p>

<p>Following is an example highlighting the status and importance in developing an audit schedule:</p>

<p>XYZ Corporation implements a steam trap program as part of an action plan to reduce energy losses. The internal audit schedule indicates that the steam trap program will be audited twice within the time frame covered by the audit schedule. The first internal audit will assess whether initial implementation of the steam trap program has been accomplished. Later in the audit schedule, the steam trap program will be re-audited to ensure that the routine inspections of the steam traps are being conducted as planned and that the program is effective in reducing steam losses.</p>

<p>[Learn More End]</p>

<p>Once you have conducted internal audits, adjustments to the audit schedule may be needed based on the results of those audits.</p>

<p>[Learn More](Adjustments to an audit schedule)</p>

<p>Following is an example of adjustments to an audit schedule:</p>

<p>In this case, the organization&rsquo;s annual internal audit schedule indicates two internal audits of a specific significant energy use (e.g., interior and exterior lighting across the building complex). If no nonconformities are identified when audits of that significant energy use are conducted, then next year&rsquo;s internal audit schedule may be modified to include only one internal audit of that specific significant energy use. On the other hand, if the internal audits reveal a consistent lack of conformance with the organization&rsquo;s EnMS requirements for that significant energy use, then the internal audit schedule for either the current year or next year (or both) may be revised to include additional audits of that significant energy use.</p>

<p>[Learn More End]</p>

<p>Examples of other reasons for modifying the audit schedule are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>New management initiatives</li>
	<li>Organizational changes</li>
	<li>Customer issues or needs</li>
	<li>Process changes</li>
	<li>EnPIs not being met</li>
	<li>New or revised energy objectives or targets</li>
</ul>

<p>The internal audit schedule may be in any format that meets your organization/s needs. Often, the schedule identifies the processes and functions/areas to be audited and the planned date(s). Some audit schedules only indicate what EnMS processes and performance will be audited and when. In either case, ensure that:</p>

<ul>
	<li>the status and importance of the functions and areas is considered, and</li>
	<li>all EnMS processes and ISO 50001 requirements are audited in all applicable functions or areas within a defined period of time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Several examples of audit schedules, as well as an [resource](Internal_Audit_Schedule_Template), are available to help you consider the format that is best for your organization: [resource](Example_Internal_Audit_Schedule), [resource](Example_Format_Internal_Audit_ Schedule_Commercial_Building), [resource](Example_Format_Internal_Audit_ Schedule_Manufacturing).</p>

<p>[Accordion End]</p>

<p>[Accordion](Develop the audit plan)</p>

<p>An internal audit plan or agenda is prepared for each internal audit. Typically, this plan is prepared by the internal audit program manager, a lead auditor, or audit team leader. It often includes the following basic information:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Date(s) of the audit</li>
	<li>Objectives of the audit</li>
	<li>Processes and area(s) to be audited</li>
	<li>Auditor(s) responsible for auditing each process and area</li>
	<li>Timing</li>
	<li>Requirements (criteria) and references</li>
</ul>

<p>[Learn More](Examples of common audit objectives and audited processes)</p>

<p>Examples of common audit objectives are to evaluate the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Conformity with the requirements of ISO 50001 and the EnMS</li>
	<li>Conformity with the established energy objectives and targets</li>
	<li>Implementation and effectiveness of the EnMS</li>
	<li>Energy performance improvement</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples of processes to be audited include, but are not limited to, those associated with the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Management responsibility</li>
	<li>Significant energy uses</li>
	<li>Energy objectives</li>
	<li>Energy targets and energy management action plans</li>
	<li>Communication and awareness</li>
	<li>Operational and maintenance controls</li>
	<li>Control of documentation</li>
	<li>Internal audits</li>
	<li>Corrective action and preventive action</li>
</ul>

<p>The [resource](Example_Internal_Audit_Plan_Commercial), the [resource](Example_Internal_Audit_Plan_Industrial), and the [resource](Internal_Audit_Plan_Template) can help you develop an audit plan.</p>

<p>[Accordion End]</p>

<p>[Accordion](Select and train internal auditors)</p>

<p>Internal audits are conducted by personnel who have been trained in internal auditing for management systems. The pool of internal auditors should have cross-functional representation. The audits can be conducted by a single auditor or by one or more teams. In either case, the person(s) conducting the internal audit needs to be objective and impartial, and does not audit his or her own work. Internal auditors are usually trained by experienced internal auditors or by an external training course provider.</p>

<p>Auditor training typically consists of the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Requirements of ISO 50001</li>
	<li>Objectives of the audit</li>
	<li>How to develop and use a checklist</li>
	<li>How to collect and assess objective evidence</li>
	<li>How to document both positive and negative findings</li>
	<li>How to prepare a report of the results</li>
</ul>

<p>[Accordion End]</p>

<p>[Accordion](Conduct internal audits)</p>

<p>Internal audits identify both areas of success and areas in need of improvement. In conducting the audit, the internal auditors focus on determining if your organization is:</p>

<ul>
	<li>doing what it says it will do,</li>
	<li>conforms with its energy objectives and targets,</li>
	<li>continually improving its EnMS, and</li>
	<li>achieving improvement in energy performance.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both the selection of auditors and the method for conducting the audits need to demonstrate that the process is objective and impartial. Each auditor is expected to carry out his or her assigned responsibilities as set out in the audit plan.</p>

<p>When conducting an internal audit, auditors collect objective evidence by:</p>

<ul>
	<li>interviewing personnel,</li>
	<li>observing activities,</li>
	<li>reviewing documents, and</li>
	<li>examining records and data.</li>
</ul>

<p>Audit checklists are often used to help organize and document the evidence and the audit findings.</p>

<p>[Accordion End]</p>

<p>[Accordion](Report internal audit results to top management)</p>

<p>Some organizations record internal audit findings on an [resource](Audit_Finding_Form). Other organizations record negative findings directly onto a [resource](Corrective_Action_Preventive_Action_Request_Form) and list the positive findings within an audit report or other summary of the audit results. It is up to you how your audit results are recorded.</p>

<p>The reporting of internal audit results to top management is part of the management review process (see [task](Management Review)). The level of detail presented on the audit results should be appropriate to the needs of top management. Corrective action on negative findings should be taken in a timely manner.</p>

<p>[Accordion End]</p>

<p>[Accordion](Maintain records of results)</p>

<p>ISO 50001 requires you to maintain records of internal audit results, both positive and negative. Typical records consist of the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Audit schedule</li>
	<li>Audit plan(s)</li>
	<li>Auditor training records</li>
	<li>Audit nonconformity reports or completed corrective action records</li>
	<li>Audit reports of findings</li>
</ul>

<p>More detailed information about internal auditing is presented in [resource](Introduction_Internal_Auditing_Concepts). It is strongly recommended that if your organization is new to ISO management systems, you should review fully that document.</p>

----------OTHER ISO EXPERIENCE TIPS----------
<p>There are very few differences between the structure and management of an internal audit programs for ISO 50001:2011 and those required for ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 14001:2015. The ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 standards actually have a few more specific program requirements (e.g. defining audit criteria and scope for each audit, taking into consideration changes affecting the organization) than are included in ISO 50001. Even if an organization chooses not to conduct integrated management system audits, the ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and ISO 50001 systems can share common procedures for internal audit planning, conducting and reporting. Or, alternatively, if the systems are to be maintained separately, the structure and requirements of those existing ISO 9001 or ISO 14001 internal audit processes, procedures, methods and responsibilities can be easily copied and adapted for an ISO 50001 EnMS.</p>

<p>The key difference in internal audit requirements between ISO 50001 and the ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 standards is related to the intent of an internal audit. In addition to ensuring conformance and effective implementation and maintenance of the management system, ISO 50001 internal audits are conducted to ensure that the EnMS actually <em>improves</em> energy performance. One practical implication of this ISO 50001 requirement relates to the training and competency of the internal auditors. The pool of internal auditors for ISO 50001 must include personnel who are comfortable with (preferably experienced with) evaluation of data and data analyses. These skills may already be included among the members of the existing internal auditor pool, for example where internal auditors for ISO 9001 are experienced with evaluating quality data. In ISO 14001 systems, environmental performance must also be evaluated; however, this could be implemented only through the processes for monitoring, measurement, analysis and evaluation, not through the internal audit process itself. So, some adjustments to the skills sets of the internal auditors may be needed to effectively audit energy performance in an ISO 50001 system. Certainly, existing internal auditors for quality and environmental management systems would need training in the requirements of ISO 50001 and the energy topics addressed in that standard in order to conduct internal audits of the EnMS.</p>

<p>Like ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 14001:2015, the ISO 5001-2011 standard requires the reporting of internal audit results. For ISO 50001, those results must be reported to &ldquo;top management.&rdquo; For ISO 9001 and 14001, internal audit results are reported to &ldquo;relevant management.&rdquo; From a practical perspective, there may be very little difference in &ldquo;to whom&rdquo; the results are reported across these different management systems. However, for the purposes of integrating ISO 50001 with ISO 9001 or ISO 14001, &ldquo;relevant management&rdquo; would have to include &ldquo;top management.&rdquo;</p>
----------ENERGY STAR EXPERIENCE TIPS----------
<p>This guidance is relevant to Step 5.1, Step 5.2, Step 5.5, Step 6.1 and Step 6.2 of the [resource](ENERGY_STAR_Guidelines_for_Energy_Management). You can leverage and modify elements of these ENERGY STAR Guidelines in developing an EnMS internal audit program, however additional work will be needed to meet ISO 50001 requirements for conducting EnMS internal audits based on documented internal audit procedures, schedules, and plans. The ENERGY STAR Guidelines recommend creating a communications plan and raising awareness across the facility. ISO 50001 specifically requires documenting and maintaining records of internal audit results and ensuring that the results are communicated to top management as part of management&rsquo;s review of the performance of the EnMS and the organization&rsquo;s energy performance.</p>
