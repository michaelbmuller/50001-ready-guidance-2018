----------MENU NAME----------
Risks to EnMS Success
----------TITLE----------
Task 7: We determine strategic risks and opportunities to ensure that our organization can achieve the intended outcomes of our EnMS and energy performance improvement. We plan and implement actions to address these risks and opportunities and evaluate the effectiveness of the actions taken.
----------GETTING IT DONE----------
<ol>
<li>Use the [task](An EnMS and Your Organization) Worksheet or similar document to identify the risks and opportunities pertaining to the ability of your EnMS to achieve its intended outcomes.</li>
<li>For each of the identified risks and opportunities, plan and implement actions to address them using the processes of the EnMS. Add this information to the Worksheet or similar document.</li>
<li>Plan for how the actions taken will be evaluated for effectiveness. Perform an effectiveness evaluation.</li>
</ol>
----------TASK OVERVIEW----------
<p>The risk-opportunity approach of this task is intended to help your organization mitigate risks and take advantage of opportunities to position your EnMS for success.</p>
<p>This task is concerned with planning the EnMS from a strategic perspective and should be reviewed on an annual basis. It involves anticipating the potential consequences to the EnMS and energy performance improvement from the risks and opportunities identified in previous tasks. This part of EnMS planning allows potential negative consequences to be addressed before they occur and potential positive consequences with beneficial outcomes to be identified and pursued.</p>
<p>Begin by identifying the risks and opportunities arising from the strategic external and internal issues identified in [task](An EnMS and Your Organization) and [task](People and Legal Requirements Affecting the EnMS). Remember to limit your review of these issues on identifying the risks and opportunities that need to be addressed to ensure that continual improvement of the EnMS and energy performance improvement can be achieved. Once identified, actions to address the risks and opportunities and plans to evaluate action effectiveness should be developed.</p>
<p><em>This guidance is relevant to Section 6.1 of the ISO 50001:2018 standard.</em></p>
----------FULL DESCRIPTION----------
<p>[Learn More](Determine the strategic external and internal issues that may affect your organization&rsquo;s ability to improve energy performance and achieve the intended outcomes of your EnMS)</p>

<p>In order to determine strategic issues that may affect your organization&rsquo;s ability to improve its energy performance and achieve the intended outcomes of the EnMS, information about the organization&rsquo;s strategic objectives and challenges are needed. This information may have already been identified as part of the organization&rsquo;s strategic or long-term planning process. Having management input into the determination of the relevant issues is desired not only to expedite the process but also to show management that the EnMS considers strategic issues facing the organization. However, it is not unusual for management to not be involved in this process and for the energy team to develop this information on its own. In this case the information should be presented to top management for their review and input. This approach presumes that the energy team has access to the relevant information about the organization&rsquo;s strategic direction, goals, and challenges.</p>

<p>Examples of strategic external issues may include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>economic and financial conditions</li>
	<li>competitive circumstances</li>
	<li>legal and regulatory requirements</li>
	<li>technological developments</li>
	<li>political, social, and cultural conditions</li>
	<li>environmental conditions</li>
	<li>restrictions on energy supply</li>
	<li>effects of climate change</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples of strategic internal issues may include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>core business objectives and strategies</li>
	<li>governance and organizational structure</li>
	<li>information flows and decision-making processes</li>
	<li>organizational culture and knowledge</li>
	<li>organizational policies</li>
	<li>financial resources</li>
	<li>technological maturity</li>
	<li>sustainability goals</li>
</ul>

<p>In performing this task, keep in mind that the relevant issues are those that may affect your organization&rsquo;s ability to achieve the intended outcomes of your EnMS and energy performance improvement. The completed Worksheets contains examples of the strategic external and internal issues identified by several organizations that have implemented these requirements.</p>

<p>The Worksheet for your optional use. As with most of the optional Worksheets in the Navigator, you can adopt this resource for your EnMS or simply use it to generate ideas on how you may want to capture the information generated by this task.</p>

----------OTHER ISO EXPERIENCE TIPS----------
<p>Requirements for determining and taking action to address risks and opportunities is common text from ISOâ€™s High Level Structure. As such, ISO 9001:2015, ISO 14001:2015 and other ISO management system standards contain similar requirements, but the details can vary. For example, ISO 14001 additionally requires the determination of risks and opportunities related to environmental aspects. The approaches or methods used to identify the risks and opportunities that need to be addressed likely can be applied across the various management systems. The same is true for how associated actions are planned, implemented and evaluated for effectiveness.</p>
----------ENERGY STAR EXPERIENCE TIPS----------
<p>The ENERGY STAR Guidelines for Energy Management does not specifically address the determination of strategic risks and opportunities that can affect the intended outcomes of the EnMS and energy performance improvement. </p>
